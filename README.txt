Prototype is named as "final_prototype.py"
Code used for preprocessing the data for training the model is named as "facedetection.py"

The model data used for facial recoginition is saved in the final file named "model_data".
The labels for the original data and the final annotations for the data are stored in "Labels".
Code is stored in folder named "project".
